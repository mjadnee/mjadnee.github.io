     My name is Maren and I am a physics and mathematics student at the University of Maine.
<br>
         I like statistics, geometry, and physics. 
<br>
         I hope to better understand the nature of space and time by using advanced statistical methods to analyze data from experiments neutrino, gravitational wave, and dark matter detection.
<br>
         I also developed a deep appreciation for the arts while living in Kyoto, aka the greatest city on earth. 
  I have a small portfolio of math and physics related art works which I am compiling into an portfolio.
  <br>
  If you are interested in seeing it or collaborating on an art project, please reach out to me at maren.adnee@gmail.com.
  <br>
  I do not post my artwork online. Please do not feed the bots!
<br>
         Someday I will make this into a real website, but for now, you can find my CV here:</p>
